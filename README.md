# Arduino Basic Music

Use any digital output pin on any `digitalWrite()` Arduino function compatible board to 
generate basic sounds and music notes with customizable tempo and pitch.

No need for any extra libraries. It can be used with any board which doesn't support 
`tone()` special Arduino output function, for example ESP32.

There are on-code predefined music notes frequencies from B0 to D#8 with a standard A4 
note frequency of 440Hz.
